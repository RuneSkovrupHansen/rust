# rust
Repository for experimenting with the Rust programming language

# Hello, world!

rustc - The Rust compiler
rustup - The Rust toolchain tool

Main, fn main() {}, is special, always the first code that runs in every executable Rust program.

rustfmt - Standard Rust formatting tool

Using "!", ex. name!(), means we're calling a macro and not a function. Different rules.

 Rust is an ahead-of-time compiled language, meaning you can compile a program and give the executable to someone else, and they can run it even without having Rust installed.

# Hello, cargo!

Build system and package manager, common to use for Rust.

`cargo new <name>` creates new package, including setup.

TOML (Tom’s Obvious, Minimal Language) format, Cargo’s configuration format.

In Rust, packages of code are referred to as crates.

Cargo expects certain structure, src files in src/, etc.

`cargo build`
`cargo run`
`cargo check` - Checks compilation, does not produce executable, a lot faster then build.

When your project is finally ready for release, you can use cargo build --release to compile it with optimizations. This command will create an executable in target/release instead of target/debug.
